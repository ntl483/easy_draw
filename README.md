# easy_draw
DISCLAIMER This is mostly for training, so it's not that important if it's actually useful.
In some Rafa≈Ç Kosik's book (can't remember which one) there's a way of drawing what to do easily - one persone associates colors to
choices and the other chooses a color - that way, no one is to blame if it's the wrong decision.
This app will allow you to draw things that way.
